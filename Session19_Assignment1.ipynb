    "================\n",
    " In supervise approach output is known and a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It deals with labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. The standard approach to supervised learning is to split the set of example into the training set and the test set.\n",

    " Training set:\n",
    " \n",
    "    In Machine Learning, data set is devided into a training and test sets. Training sets are used to train a model. In training the model, specific features are picked out from the training set. These features are then incorporated into the model.The model is trained on the training dataset using a supervised learning method . thereby, if the training set is labeled correctly, the model should be able to learn something from these features.\n",
    "    In other words, the set of data which is used to discover the potentially predictive relationship is known as ‘Training Set’. \n",
    "   In practice, the training dataset often consist of pairs of an input vector and the corresponding output vector, which is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training dataset and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training dataset. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation. Successively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second dataset called the validation dataset\n",

    "    If the prediction scores for the test set are unreasonable, we’ll have to make some adjustments to our model and try again.\n",
    "    In other words, the Test set is used to test the accuracy of the model generated by the training data set. \n",

    "Answer:\n",
    "================\n",
    "The general principle of ensemble methods is to construct a linear combination of some model fitting methods, instead of using a single fit of the method\n",

    "An ensemble method is to combine the predictions of several models built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve robustness over a single model.  \n",
